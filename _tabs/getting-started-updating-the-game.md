# Modifying game data
If you need to change the game description, poster, release date, etc., go to the [**Games**](https://vrp.arvilab.com/development/games) section and select **Edit** in the game menu. Then click **Submit** to save changes.

# Adding a new version
The process of adding new game versions is the same as [creating new version]({{ '/tabs/getting-started-adding-the-game/#creating-new-version' | relative_url }}).
> **Note**: Each time you click **Upload**, a new version will be created on the site. Even if you specify an existing version name, a new version will be created.

# Updating game distribution
After adding a new game version you need to re-distribute it to locations similar to [distribution procedure]({{ '/tabs/getting-started-adding-the-game/#game-distribution' | relative_url }}). In the list of versions, select the new version, add it to the required locations -- and the new version will be there when the games are updated in these locations.  
Contact your manager or our support [vr.support@arvilab.com](mailto:vr.support@arvilab.com) to publish a new version and distribute it to all public locations.
