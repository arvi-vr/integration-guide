# Welcome to ARVI VR Integration Guide!
This guide serves as a starting point for adding and integrating your games with ARVI VR. It provides all the necessary documentation, plugins and code examples for integrating games.

# How to use this guide?
This guide contains sections that are arranged in a specific order to help you get started. The order forms a structured process in itself, which helps you kick-start the games integration. You can choose to follow the order from start to finish, or use it as a standalone reference.  
It contains the following sections:
- **`GETTING STARTED`**: Describes the process of setting up a location, adding a game to the platform and then updating it.
- **`INTEGRATIONS`**: Describes how to integrate games with the platform using plugins and provides code examples.
- **`TESTING`**: Describes the procedure for testing integration using the API Tester utility.
- **`DOWNLOADS`**: Provides links to download plugins and developer tools required for integration.

# Have any questions?
We try to maintain a comprehensive set of documentation. However, we realize that often there are questions that remain unanswered. For any technical questions relating to game maintenance and integration not answered here, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DQHrdaS9pc) or contact our support [vr.support@arvilab.com](mailto:vr.support@arvilab.com).
